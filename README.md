# NIHSocialMediaProject
Rare Diseases Social Media Project for NIH. This project looks at mining information from social media (Reddit) and finding subreddits that are related to different rare diseases found in the GARD database. The project matches rare diseases to Reddit subreddits, downloads the post and comment data, and then analyzes the text data to find the different topics that people are talking about.

The project is split into four parts.
1. Mapper package called NormMap v2.
2. Reddit post/comment retrieval scripts.
3. Topic Modeling of text using top2vec.
4. Topic Modeling of text using LDA. (legacy)
